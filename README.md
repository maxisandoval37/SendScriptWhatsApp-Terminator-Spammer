# SendScriptWhatsApp
Code to send the entire script of Movie to your friends or WhatsApp groups.

## Usage
1. Open <..>sendScript.js
2. Copy all the content (click on raw -> ctrl+a -> ctrl+c)
3. In WhatsApp Web, open the Browser console.
4. Paste the code in the console and press Enter.

### ⚠️ Important notice

In a recent update of Google Chrome, pasting scripts in the Console is being blocked.

To work around this issue, the developer console expects a text confirmation by typing "allow pasting" in the console.

After that, pasting will be allowed, and you can continue running the script.

Done!
